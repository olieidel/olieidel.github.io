Books that I've read, in chronological order, some with comments.

## 2018

### House of God (Samuel Shem)

It was a great read and comparing it to my limited hospital experience
sadly many things ring true. I recommend this book to all new medical
students and hope they take it seriously.

### It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work (Jason Fried, DHH)

Feels a bit like an extension to Rework. Good content and very
concise.

### Inside Apple (Adam Lashinsky)

Found this book while tidying up. Not recommended - I prefer
Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs instead. On a side note, it may be
interesting to check out the recent book of Steve Jobs' daughter for
different perspective (Small Fry by Lisa Brennan-Jobs).

### Being Mortal (Atul Gawande)

A great read about how our society and healthcare system fail at
dealing with the growing challenges of "treating" the elderly.

### Bad Blood (John Carreyrou)

Crazy story and well written. Hard to put down this book. Finished in
a few days.

### Complications (Atul Gawande)

Interesting read even (or especially?) for someone with a medical
background like me.

### Rework (Jason Fried, DHH)

Super concise, these guy's to-the-point mentality really shines
through. Heavily recommended.

### The Personal MBA (Josh Kaufman)

Condensed and to the point. Great read for non-business people like
me.

### Benjamin Franklin (Walter Isaacson)

Would have loved to meet this guy (Franklin, not Isaacson) in person,
he seems to have been quite entertaining. I'd like to emphasize his
[Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress][franklin-advice].

### Principles (Ray Dalio)

### Why We Sleep (Matthew Walker)

A must-read for everyone who sleeps.

## 2017

### The Black Swan (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)

### Hatching Twitter (Nick Bilton)

Quite entertaining read about the early stages and intrigues of
Twitter.

### Outliers (Malcolm Gladwell)

### Losing My Virginity (Richard Branson)

### Made in America (Sam Walton)

Not as interesting as the reviews might suggest. I found it rather
light on facts.

### Delivering Happiness (Tony Hsieh)

A great read and Tony Hsieh's humor really resonates with me.

### The Upstarts (Brad Stone)

### The Everything Store (Brad Stone)

### Shoe Dog (Phil Knight)

Awesome and captivating book focusing on Phil Knight's
"not-so-obvious" and emotional challenges of growing his business,
Nike.

### Deep Work (Cal Newport)

A must-read for everyone who wants to get stuff done.

## 2016

### The 7 Day Startup (Dan Norris)

Not that rich in content. You could summarize it by saying "ship your
product fast and gather feedback".

### Zero to One (Peter Thiel)

### So Good They Can't Ignore You (Cal Newport)

### Originals (Adam Grant)

### Sherlock Holmes Books (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)

A great read! Especially fun to discover all the hidden references
after watching the series with Benedict Cumberbatch.

### High Price (Carl Hart)

A really interesting and arguably more realistic perspective on drug
usage.
