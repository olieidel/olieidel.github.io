## 2017

### Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell

A great read and Tony Hsieh's humor really resonates with me.

Awesome and captivating book focusing on Phil Knight's
"not-so-obvious" and emotional challenges of growing his business,
Nike.

### The 7 Day Startup by Dan Norris

product fast and gather feedback".

### So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport

### Sherlock Holmes Books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
