## ClojuTRE (09/2018)

[ClojuTRE][clojutre-2018]{:target="_blank"} is an awesome
conference. While being one of the largest Clojure conferences in
Europe, it still has a very familiar atmosphere. Maybe due to the
saunas and the friendly [Metosin][metosin]{:target="_blank"} people
who organize it?

I presented my side project in which I tracked all food I ate and lots
of other activities for 3 months or so, yielding a spreadsheet with
1700 rows. The aim was to analyze whether there are certain things
which influence my mental focus. The biggest finding was that sleeping
longer correlates with a drop in concentration which seems very weird.

## Django Meetup (04/2018)

We hosted a Django Meetup at Merantix. I talked about my dating app
Philter which I had coded while applying for jobs - the backend of it
was actually done using [Django REST
framework][django-rest-framework]{:target="_blank"}!

## DRG-Forum (03/2018)

I talked at the *DRG-Forum*, the largest conference in Germany for
hospital managers, bringing together people from research, politics
and business.

I gave a brief introduction into what Machine / Deep Learning is by
walking the audience through the process of creating a cat vs. dog
classifier. Note my creative animal names (Yoda, Godzilla, ..).

Then, I talked about potential applications of "AI" in Medicine.

Note: Talk is in German. Animal names are universal.

## Clojure Berlin Meetup (12/2017)

This was my first ever Clojure Meetup so I went all in and gave a talk
presenting the medical image viewer we (or rather, I) had just started
building at Merantix.

I focused mainly on the problem of synchronizing state between
"html-dom-land" and "three.js webgl - land". The latter is difficult
to hook up to re-frame because all those three.js objects are quite
mutable by nature.
