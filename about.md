title: About Me
---

Hello! I am Oliver. I am a medical doctor and love coding. Currently,
I'm working at [Merantix][merantix]{:target="_blank"} in Berlin where
we're developing medical software (you guessed it).

You may contact me via [e-mail][email].

## Three-Sentence Bio

I started coding when I was twelve even though it's quite a stretch to
call writing hacky php code *coding*. Wanting to have some purpose in
life I ended up becoming a doctor. However I also wanted to build
things so I got back into coding while doing MRI research for my
doctorate thesis.

## Projects

I did quite some [radiology research][publications] for my doctorate
thesis, mainly with Matlab.

At some stage, I was intrigued whether masturbation had an effect on
our behaviour, specifically, our mood, energy and libido. Quite
obviously, this is a problem which can be solved with an app, so I
developed an app together with my friend
[Chris][chris]{:target="_blank"}:
[NofApp][nofapp]{:target="_blank"}. (Note: I think it's not visible in
the US Play Store any more due to some trademark voodoo - use a VPN or
ask me for a demo).

I worked as a React Native developer for [phellow
seven][phellowseven]{:target="_blank"} developing an app for patients
to view and manage their Electronic Health Records.

While figuring out what to do with my life, I developed a dating app
called [Philter][philter]{:target="_blank"} which lets you filter (get
it?) people close by based on your answers to yes/no questions.

Nowadays, I'm a big fan of
[Clojure][clojure]{:target="_blank"}. Chances are you'll run into me
at one of the [Clojure Berlin][clojureberlin]{:target="_blank"}
meetups.
