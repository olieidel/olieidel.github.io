title: About Me
---

Hello! I am Oliver. I am a Medical Doctor, Software Engineer and
Regulatory Affairs Person.

You can contact me via [e-mail][email].

## Bio

I started coding when I was twelve even though it's quite a stretch to
call writing hacky php scripts *coding*. I ended up graduating as a
Medical Doctor. While doing MRI research for my doctorate thesis, I
got reminded how fun coding was and realized how broken medical
software is.

I taught myself programming and started working on medical
software. Right now, I think improving software is one of the largest
levers we have for improving healthcare.

## Projects

I did quite some [radiology research][publications] for my doctorate
thesis, mainly with Matlab.

At some stage, I was intrigued whether masturbation had an effect on
our behaviour, specifically, our mood, energy and libido. Quite
obviously, this is a problem which can be solved with an app, so I
developed an app together with my friend
[Chris][chris]{:target="_blank"}: [NofApp][nofapp]{:target="_blank"}
(it may have been taken down by the Play Store by now).

I worked as a React Native developer for [phellow
seven][phellowseven]{:target="_blank"} developing a patient-centric
Electronic Health Record app.

I developed a dating app called [Philter][philter]{:target="_blank"}
(also offline by now) which lets you filter (haha) people close to you
based on your answers to yes/no questions.

I currently work at [Merantix][merantix]{:target="_blank"} where we
develop medical software.

I'm a big fan of [Clojure][clojure]{:target="_blank"}. Chances are
you'll run into me at one of the [Clojure
Berlin][clojureberlin]{:target="_blank"} meetups.
