I'm currently reading *Range* by David Epstein [1].

I was deeply impressed by the section about Gunpei Yokoi, the guy at
Nintendo who was the driving force behind the NES and Game Boy. I have
fond memories of the Game Boy; everyone who was a kid in the nineties
does. This awesome *thing* you could hold in our hands, that was some
great *technology*.

Except that it wasn't. Here's how the technology of the Game Boy
stacked up at the time:

> From a technical standpoint, even in 1989, the Game Boy was
> laughable. Yokoi's team cut every corner. The Game Boy's processor had

Yokoi got it right. The best game console is not defined by its
technology but by its *user experience*. Kids don't care about
CPUs. Grown-ups don't, either. We never do. Neither in game consoles
nor in smartphones. We care about whether something *gets the job
done*.

Unless we're developers. That's where the problems start. When we
focus on technology first, we lose sight of the *user experience*, or,
as Yokoi says:

> He advised young employees not just to play with technology for its
> own sake, but to play with ideas. Do not be an engineer, he said, be
> a producer. "The producer knows that there's such a thing as a
> semiconductor, but doesn't need to know its inner workings... That
> can be left to the experts."

And that's what we should be. *Producers*. Applying existing
technology to unsolved problems.

Only a tiny fraction of all developers should be focusing on
technology itself. Those are people working on algorithms, writing
frameworks and developing languages. Their contributions are crucial
and provide us with much-needed leverage for solving problems out
there, in the real world.

Yes, that's where the rest of us are: In the real world. Like a
plumber [2] with his toolbox in a foreign bathroom, we're out there,
solving real problems with our limited resources. Using battle-proven,
productive technology. Like Django, or Rails. *Producing*.

But what when we have competitors who are more technically advanced?

> When the Game Boy was released, Yokoi's colleague came to him "with a
> grim expression on his face," Yokoi recalled, and reported that a
> competitor handheld had hit the market. Yokoi asked him if it had a
> color screen. The man said that it did. "Then we're fine," Yokoi
> replied.

So the next time you find a competitor and they're building a
Progressive Web Application which is Cloud Native, leveraging AI and
the Blockchain, you can breathe a sigh of relief. You're free to
improve your *user experience*, ship features, or in Yokoi's words,
*produce*.

the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center upon rescuing
Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser."
