### Automatic Analysis of Cellularity in Glioblastoma and Correlation with ADC Using Trajectory Analysis and Automatic Nuclei Counting

07/2016 / [PloS one](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160250)

Correlating histologic cellularity with the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)
measured in MRI (there's a negative correlation).

#### Quantification of Tumor Vessels in Glioblastoma Patients Using Time-of-Flight Angiography at 7 Tesla: A Feasibility Study

11/2014 / [PloS one](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110727)

The first in-vivo display of Glioblastoma Tumor vessels with an automatic
segmentation algorithm using a 7 Tesla MRI Scanner (it works).

#### Gadolinium retention in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus is dependent on the class of contrast agent

04/2015 / [Radiology](http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2015150337)

A widely used group of MRI contrast agents is associated with signal intensity
elevation in patients' brains.

#### Clinical parameters outweigh diffusion- and perfusion-derived MRI parameters in predicting survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma

05/2016 / [Neuro-Oncology](http://neuro-oncology.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/12/1673.short)

Clinical parameters in patients with glioblastoma are more relevant for survival
prediction than MRI-derived parameters.

#### Radiomic Profiling of Glioblastoma: Identifying an Imaging Predictor of Patient Survival with Improved Performance over Established Clinical and Radiologic Risk Models

09/2016 / [Radiology](http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2016160845)

Lots of features were extracted from MRI-images (far more than in the study above),
a subset of which could better predict survival than clinical parameters.

#### Radiogenomics of Glioblastoma: Machine Learningâ€“based Classification of Molecular Characteristics by Using Multiparametric and Multiregional MR Imaging Features

12/2016 / [Radiology](http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2016161382)

It's not really possible to predict molecular parameters from MRI-derived
parameters.

#### Time-dependent parameter of perfusion imaging as independent predictor of clinical outcome in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis

04/2016 / [BMC Neurology](https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-016-0576-5)

MRI-derived parameters perform better than sonographically measured degree
of stenosis in predicting patient outcomes of symptomatic
internal carotid artery stenosis.
