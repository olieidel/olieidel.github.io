    <p>Let’s look at how most software is developed. I’m not talking about
those shiny SaaS products like Slack. Those were built for developers,
by other developers. No, I’m talking about the large underwater
iceberg of <em>boring</em> software running enterprises, governments,
hospitals and nuclear reactors. Real-world software. Software outside
the Silicon Valley tech bubble.</p>

<p>How does any such development process unfold?</p>

<p>Step one. Businesspeople visit potential customers. This activity is
commonly called <em>market research</em> and/or <em>gathering customer
requirements</em>. In the end, it’s just some people visiting some other
people. More importantly, the businesspeople are observers of real
problems the customers face. The businesspeople don’t experience them
first-hand; they only see how others experience it. This distinction
is important.</p>

<p>Step two. After having observed customers problems, they come up with
a product which attempts to solve at least one of them. In our
industry, this product is software.</p>

<p>Step three. The specification of bespoke software (let’s hope there is
one) is handed to developers who shall implement it. But wait, you’ll
say, those developers have never been exposed to the problem they
ought to solve - they’re relying on descriptions by businesspeople who
themselves only observed other people experiencing it. And how long
did they do that? An hour between drawing Powerpoint slides, maybe?</p>

<p>You don’t have to be a developer to realize that this process is
flawed. Developing the wrong thing is one of the main pitfalls of
modern software development.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, Agile Development came to the rescue, putting more emphasis
on iterative software design with more customer involvement. As <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html">Steve
Yegge</a> accurately points out, Agile Development is
all about giving developers revenge: Now it’s their turn to treat
businesspeople like infants.</p>

<p>They introduced stand-up meetings so that people would talk to each
other. Okay. They involved the customer regularly by forcing one of
them to sit in developer meetings. Fine.</p>

<p>And it worked - sort of. Software development has become more
iterative. We still develop the wrong thing and miss deadlines. But
now we notice earlier.</p>

<p>But the core problem still remains unsolved: A huge amount of human
overhead is lost to communicating. And most of that communication is a
feedback loop whether developers are developing the right thing.</p>

<p>What if we could have a stand-up meeting in your head, with infinite
bandwidth, every few seconds? What if we could get customers feedback
on every subtle UI change instantly?</p>

<p>Enter the full-stack person. Not to be confused with the full-stack
developer. While the full-stack developer covers everything from
frontend to backend, the full-stack <em>person</em> covers that and
everything else, too. Everything. Because he is the customer - and the
developer.</p>

<p>The full-stack person is a jack of all trades - enough trades at
least - and an expert at nothing. He has been sufficiently exposed to
the problem to be solved; he knows exactly what a product must deliver
to be a great solution. He’s a sufficiently good coder - not a
master - but solid enough to whip out a Rails app and deploy it in a
matter of hours.</p>

<p>Efforts for developing a product can roughly be grouped into the
customer/problem side which is concerned about solving the right
problem the right way, and the tech side which ensures that the
solution is implemented correctly.</p>

<p>On the customer/problem side, this means that the full-stack person
must have significant work experience in the field of the
problem. Best case, he’s still working there. Imagine being treated by
a doctor who discovers a bug in his hospital’s software and comes back
the next day having fixed it himself.</p>

<p>On the tech side, this means that the full-stack person must get
things done, fast. He can’t allow himself to get sucked into
bike-shedding technical details: Anything which slows down rapid
implementation is strictly prohibited. Copy-pasting error messages to
Google must yield fast and actionable results. Single page apps are
verboten, no native iOS / Android stuff, DevOps shouldn’t exceed
Heroku or nginx with something else, hell, if it can be done in Rails,
use Rails!</p>

<p>So, how does the full-stack person compare in real life with the
traditional team of businesspeople and developers?</p>

<p>While the businesspeople are visiting customers and searching for
<em>problems</em> to solve, the full-stack person already knows which problem
to work on and is thinking about <em>solutions</em>.</p>

<p>While the businesspeople come up with various solutions and <em>iterate</em>
on them by presenting them to customers each time, the full-stack
person can try out any solution in his head in a matter of seconds. He
can lie in the bathtub and think: I have this new idea. Will it solve
the problem? A few second later, he knows.</p>

<p>While the businesspeople are busy writing user stories and giving the
designer instructions for mock-ups, the full-stack person already has
a working MVP. It’s unpolished, but it’s a product.</p>

<p>While the designer is busy designing things which developers are
subsequently busy with translating into HTML and CSS, a matter of
days, the full-stack person just designs things in real-time by
editing code directly, in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>While the businesspeople are tied down in repeat meetings with
developers to monitor progress and no one has a clear sense of when
the product is done, the full-stack person knows this instantly. Every
night before sleeping, the full-stack person has a five-second meeting
in his head, reviewing his progress.</p>

<p>While the developers don’t fully understand the problem at hand and
start coping with this crisis of purpose by focusing on technical
details which are irrelevant (“Let’s model it as microservices! It
must scale!”), the full-stack person uses battle-proven, withered
technology that gets the job done with minimum effort and risk.</p>

<p>And that’s by far the most efficient way of building things. But
actually, efficiency isn’t even the primary goal; efficacy is, solving
the problem, building the <em>right</em> thing.</p>

<p>Once you become a full-stack person, you’re not building software for
others, you’re solving problems for yourself.</p>

<p>If you’re not one of those and all you can do is code, just approach
it from the other side: Immerse yourself in a field which is far away
from tech. You won’t believe how many low-hanging fruit there are out
there - technology-wise, our world is still very underdeveloped.</p>

<p>In a world in which people are becoming ever more specialized while
losing sight of the big picture, we need generalists, not specialists,
to get things done. We’re already moving in the right direction by
making programming more accessible. Let’s hope that, gradually, a new
generation of developers will emerge: People from non-tech fields
who’ve taught themselves to code for solving their own
problems. Full-stack people.</p>
